<b>Understanding Excel List Structure</b>:<br>
The way Excel recognises your headers is by you formatting them differently.<br>
Also make sure you don't have any empty rows or columns.<br>
<b>Sorting a list using single-level sort:</b><br>
Click into the column you wish to sort -> Data Tab -> Sort Filter -> a->z and z->a to sort ascending/descending<br>
<b>Sorting a list using multi-level sorts:</b><br>
Click into any column in the list -> Data Tab -> Sort Filter -> Big Sort Button -> Opens up custom sort window. Here you can add a secondary level for a secondary sort.<br>
<b>Using custom sorts in an Excel List:(e.g., sort by month)</b><br>
Open up custom sort window (as above) -> "Order" -> "Custom List"<br>
<b>Filter an Excel List using the AutoFilter tool:</b><br>
Click anywhere in list -> Data Tab -> Sort & Filter -> Big Filter Button -> Now you will see dropdown arrows in your column headers<br>
To see the whole list again, go to Sort & Filter and hit Clear<br>
<b>Creating subtotals in a list:</b><br>
First sort the column that you wish to find subtotals for -> Click into list -> Data -> Subtotal (on far right)<br>
This will also give you a grand total down at the bottom.<br>
Toggle between 1, 2, 3 at the left of your screen to see just subtotals, just grand total or everything. You can also click on the minus sign on the left to hide the details of some of the sections.<br>
