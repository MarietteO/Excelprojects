<h3>Section 14: Working with an Excel List</h3>
<b>Understanding Excel List Structure</b>:<br>
The way Excel recognises your headers is by you formatting them differently.<br>
Also make sure you don't have any empty rows or columns.<br>
<b>Sorting a list using single-level sort:</b><br>
Click into the column you wish to sort -> Data Tab -> Sort Filter -> a->z and z->a to sort ascending/descending<br>
<b>Sorting a list using multi-level sorts:</b><br>
Click into any column in the list -> Data Tab -> Sort Filter -> Big Sort Button -> Opens up custom sort window. Here you can add a secondary level for a secondary sort.<br>
<b>Using custom sorts in an Excel List:(e.g., sort by month)</b><br>
Open up custom sort window (as above) -> "Order" -> "Custom List"<br>
<b>Filter an Excel List using the AutoFilter tool:</b><br>
Click anywhere in list -> Data Tab -> Sort & Filter -> Big Filter Button -> Now you will see dropdown arrows in your column headers<br>
<br>Note that if you had a "count" function at the bottom to count the number of records, you won't be able to see that result anymore. But you can still manually drag open that cell to see it. However, it will still show the count for the whole list, not for the fitered result.<br>
To see the whole list again, go to Sort & Filter and hit Clear<br>
<b>Creating subtotals in a list:</b><br>
First sort the column that you wish to find subtotals for -> Click into list -> Data -> Subtotal (on far right)<br>
This will also give you a grand total down at the bottom.<br>
Toggle between 1, 2, 3 at the left of your screen to see just subtotals, just grand total or everything. You can also click on the minus sign on the left to hide the details of some of the sections.<br>
<b>Formatting a list as a table (alternating row colours):</b><br>
Click anywhere in your list -> Home Tab -> Styles -> Format as Table<br>
Now you also have a new "Design" tab with features like "remove dupicates".<br>
Design -> Table Style Options -> Total Row. Now you will have a "Total" row at the bottom of your list showing the number of records, but there is a dropdown menu where you can change the function to "Sum" etc.<br>
To add new rows at the bottom (above "Total"), click on the small black triangle in the corner of the bottom right cell, and drag it down.<br>
<br> The Total will update as you add new records.<br>
