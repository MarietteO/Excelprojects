<h3>Section 14: Working with an Excel List</h3>

Also make sure you don't have any empty rows or columns.<br>
<b>Sorting a list using single-level sort:</b><br>
Click into the column you wish to sort -> Data Tab -> Sort Filter -> a->z and z->a to sort ascending/descending<br>
<b>Sorting a list using multi-level sorts:</b><br>
Click into any column in the list -> Data Tab -> Sort Filter -> Big Sort Button -> Opens up custom sort window. Here you can add a secondary level for a secondary sort.<br>
