<h3>Section 3: Entering and Editing Text and Formulas</h3>
- If you ever import data or copy paste data from some other system into an Excel<br>
document, you might see your numeric values left aligned. Typically, you will then<br>
get a little green triangle inside the corner of those cells. You can click into one of<br>
those cells. At that little triangle in the corner, you will get a little box. And when<br>
you click the box, it'll come up with some options. And one of them will be: convert to numbers.<br>
