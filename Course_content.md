<h3>Section 3: Entering and Editing Text and Formulas</h3>
- If you ever import data or copy paste data from some other system into an Excel<br>
document, you might see your numeric values left aligned. Typically, you will then<br>
get a little green triangle inside the corner of those cells. You can click into one of<br>
those cells. At that little triangle in the corner, you will get a little box. And when<br>
you click the box, it'll come up with some options. And one of them will be: convert to numbers.<br>
- To customize date formats:<br>
Select relevant cells<br>
Home Tab -> Number Section<br>
Click on Dropdown Menu<br>
Click on More Number Formats<br>
Under 'Category', select 'Custom'<br>
Type (for example): mmm-yyyy (This will give Jan-2023)<br>
- Use Ctrl to select non-contiguous cells<br>
- RELATIVE REFERENCES:<br>
Once you've added up one column, you can copy&paste the solution into another column to similarly add that one with same number of cells, similarly positioned.<br>
- ABSOLUTE REFERENCES:<br>
Formula not able to be copied as above. Used if you always want to reference the same cell as part of different calculations (for example). Put a dollar sign before the reference. E.g. E4/$E$9. <br>
- ORDER OF OPERATIONS:<br> 
(Have a cell selected, then click on) Formulas Tab -> Formula Auditing section -> Evaluate Formula<br>
to evaluate cell's formula. Click "Evaluate" to see a step-by-step evaluation of the order in which the formula will be executed<br>
<h3>Section 4: Working with Basic Excel Functions</h3>
- THE STRUCTURE OF AN EXCEL FUNCTION:<br>
= FUNCTION NAME (ARGUMENTS/PARAMETERS), e.g. =SUM(B4:B8) [i.e. 4 through 8]<br>
* The Function Arguments Window:<br>
To open, click on fx button left of the formula bar<br>
Here, you will find description of what a particular function does.<br>
* Formulas Tab -> Function Library<br>
- EXCEL ERRORS:<br>
* #DIV/0! Divide by zero error<br>
* Adjacent cells error: Little green triangle in top left corner of cell. If you click on one of those triangles,<br>
a little diamond with an exclamation mark inside pops up. If you click on the diamond, it says "Formula omits adjacent<br>
cells", and you get the option to "update formula to include cells". This happens because Excel sees, for example,<br>
your header at the top of the column which is a date, and thinks wait, that's a number too. It's Excel trying to be<br>
helpful. So just click on the diamond and choose "Ignore error". Better, select all the cells with green triangle and<br>
choose "Ignore error" for all simultaneously.<br>
- SUM() FUNCTION:<br>
Formulas Tab -> Function Library -> Math & Trig -> SUM -> Opens up Function Arguments Window<br>
Number 1 B4:B8<br>
- MIN() AND MAX() FUNCTIONS:<br>
Formulas Tab -> Function Library -> More Functions -> Statistical<br>
OR if you click on fx (Insert Function Button) just underneath Function Library, it opens Insert Function Window<br>
where you can search for a function and also see suggested functions.<br>
If you click okay, it opens up the Function Arguments Window (see SUM() function above)<br>
OR on Formulas tab, far left: Insert Function<br>
- AVERAGE FUNCTION:<br>
Formulas Tab -> Function Library -> More Functions -> Statistical<br>
- COUNT FUNCTION<br>
Also under "Statistical".<br>
Counts numeric values (doesn't count empty cells or text values).<br>
Will not show an error, will only skip over non-numeric values.<br>
-AUTOSUM COMMAND<br>
Click in the "Total" cell, click on autosum (under Formulas tab) and press Enter to sum up your column automatically.<br>
You can even select a range of "Total" cells and sum up their columns simultaneously.<br>
Just check that it selects the correct range of cells to sum up.<br>
If not, click and drag the correct range of cells.<br>
The down arrow at the bottom of the AutoSum button provides quick access to other functions such as AVERAGE, COUNT etc.<br>
AutoSum keyboard shortcut: alt and =<br>
-USING THE AUTOFILL COMMAND TO COPY FORMULAS<br>
The Autofill is the little dot at the bottom right of a cell that you have already populated with a formula. If you move<br>
your cursor over the top of that, you get a black plus sign. Now, if you click and hold down, you can drag it over other<br>
cells where you want to execute the same formula using relative referencing.<br>
<h3>Section 5: Modifying an Excel Worksheet</h3><br>
<b>To move cells:</b> Select cells, move cursor to the border so that it turns into a cross, then left-click, hold down<br>
and drag to selected position.<br>
<b>To insert row:</b> Click on row nr on the left to select entire row. Ctrl+shift+plus will insert new row above.<br>
You can also insert new column this way.<br>
<b>To change height of cells:</b> Drag row lines</br>
<b>To autofit the width of multiple columns or height of multiple rows:</b><br>
Select your columns/rows, then autofit any one of them.<br>
<b>To hide rows/columns:</b> R-click on column/row name, then select Hide. To unhide, you can drag it back out or<br>
r-click -> unhide</br>
<b>To hide column names(alphabet) and row nrs:</b> View tab -> Show -> 4 checkmarks -> uncheck the option for Headings<br>
<b>Deleting a worksheet:</b>Can't be undone using Ctrl+z. To delete: R-click on worksheet name, choose Delete.<br>
<b>Copying a sheet within a workbook:</b> Select tab at bottom and drag to where you want it while holding in Ctrl.</br>
<b>To move/copy a sheet to another workbook:</b> Right-click --> Move or Copy</br> 
<h3>Section 6: Formatting Data in an Excel Worksheet</h3><br>
<b>Working with font formatting commands:</b> Under Home tab -> Font section: The icon that looks like a window has to do with borders.(Arrow next to it opens options.) And at the bottom right, you've got a little icon in the corner, a little right angle and arrow, which will open up the Format Cells window for some more advanced formatting options.<br>
The colours are broken up into Theme Colors and Standard Colors. You can change the Theme under Page Layout -> Themes<br>
<b>Excel cell borders continued:</b> At the bottom of borders options, "More options" opens the Format Cells window. Here, once you've made your selection, you need to click on the Preview box to solidify your formatting. Then click okay.<br>
<b>Formatting data as currency values:</b> Select your cells. Then: Home tab -> Number -> Click on arrow next to dollar sign to select your currency, eg. dollar. You can format just the first and last row as currency to make it look neat. Click on the comma (in the Number section) to remove the dollar signs.<br> 
<b>Formatting percentages</b> will round for you. You can use the two icons right of the comma on the Numbers section to add/remove decimals in your percentage.<br>
<b>Using Excel's Format Painter:</b> Under Home -> Clipboard. You can also use it to copy formatting to another sheet in the same workbook. A single click allows you to use Format Painter once. A double click means it will remain active until I click on the Format Painter again or hit Esc.<br>
<b>Creating Styles to Format Data:</b> A Cell Style is saved formatting. Updating the style will update all the cells using that style. Home -> Styles -> Cell Styles. You can use any of the suggested ones or click on New Cell Style to open up the Style window. Here, unclick "Number" if you don't want all your cells formatted as numbers. Now click on Format (inside Style Window) to apply some formatting to your new style. After creating it, go back to Cell Styles to apply your new style. 
<b>Merging and centering cells:</b>Highlight the cells you want to merge -> Home Tab -> Alignment -> Merge & Center<br>
<b>Conditional Formatting:</b> For example: I want a cell to turn red if it's above $500 (or some other condition). Select relevant selection of cells -> Home Tab -> Styles -> Conditional Formatting -> Highlight Cell Rules<br>
<b>Editing Excel Conditional Formatting:</b> Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules<br>
<h3>Section 7: Inserting Images and Shapes into an Excel Worksheet</h3><br>
<b>Inserting Images or Excel Shapes:</b> Insert -> Illustrations. (Left click and drag in cell to drop your shape.)<br>
<b>Formatting Excel Shapes:</b> If you click on a shape, some little circular markers will show up. The little white markers will allow you to resize the shape. The little orange markers will allow you to change the thickness. Clicking on the shape will also create a new tab at the top of your screen: Shape Format. Here you can change colours etc.<br>
<b>Working with Excel SmartArt:</b> Insert -> Illustrations -> SmartArt<br> Selecting one creates the SmartArt Design tab and the Format tab. To change the text: SmartArt Design -> Text Pane (far left). If you hit enter between two text points here, it will create a new shape. Delete the shape by hitting backspace. To add sub-bullets, hit enter, then hit tab. <br>
<h3>Section 8: Creating Basic Charts in Excel</h3><br>
<b>Creating an Excel Column Chart:</b> Select data -> Insert tab -> Charts -> Column chart (top left)<br>
Shortcut key F11 with data selected will place the chart on a new chart sheet<br>
<b>Working with the Excel Chart Ribbon:</b> When you select your graph, you get three icons to the right of it. The first one is about adding/removing chart elements, the next one is about formatting, and the funnel is your filter command. You can also, with the chart selected, use the Chart Design and Format tabs at the top of the screen.<br>
<b>Adding and Modifying Data on an Excel Chart:</b> Select your chart, go up to Chart Design tab, find the section called Data. Click on Select Data. To change data range, delete existing data range and select new range in your data. Hold down the control key to select non-adjacent data. (There is a bug where sometimes the header of the missing data will still show up in your chart. Just right click on it and choose Format Axis. Then change the Axis type. That should solve it.)<br>
<b>Formatting an Excel chart:</b> With the chart selected, we get those two new tabs at the top of the screen. On the Cart Design tab, we've got some canned styles. Hover over them to get a preview. You can also go to the Format tab to format any individual part of your graph, e.g., to change colour. You can also go to Home tab for some more formatting options. Select the chart title box (don't click in the box), click in formula (fx) bar, type the = sign. You can now attach that box to a cell or value on the worksheet itself. That way, if the workbook updates, my chart will update with it. Now click on the cell you wish to connect, click enter, and there it is. The data inside the chart is already connected to the spreadsheet, so if you update it in the spreadsheet, it will change on the chart as well. If for some reason the chart title isn't there at all, you can select the chart, go to Chart Design, and on the left there's an option for Add Chart Element. You can also use this to move elements, e.g., legend from bottom to top.<br> 
<b>Moving a chart to another worksheet:</b> Select chart -> Chart Design -> Move Chart. New Sheet will contain a chart worksheet that only contains the chart. The chart is still connected to the original data.<br>
<b>Working with Excel pie charts:</b> Pie charts are best suited for depicting (and by default it does) a single row or column.<br>
Select data, Insert tab -> Charts -> Pie chart<br>
Chart Design -> Switch Row/Column can be useful if your chart didn't display correctly.<br>
Chart Design -> Select Data to charge the chart's data (e.g., if you want different row/column)<br>
Delete the Chart Data Range and select the new columns/rows you want.<br>
To label the pie segments: Chart Design -> Add Chart Element (far left) -> Data Labels<br>
To change those data labels e.g., from value to percentage: Right click on one, choose Format Data Labels<br>
You can drag out the values if you want and a tail will show up connecting the values to the pie<br>
<b>Filtering chart data:</b> Filters will allow you to remove content temporarily from the chart.<br>
Select the Chart -> At Top Right corner of chart you will find the FILTER button.<br>
<b>Creating chart templates:</b> 
• Right Click the existing chart – SAVE AS TEMPLATE<br>
• Give the Chart Template a name and click SAVE.<br>
By default, the Chart Template will be saved in the Chart Templates folder
location on your computer.<br>
To Apply Template: Go to the INSERT tab – CHART OPTIONS – ALL CHARTS – TEMPLATES<br>
<b>Printing charts:</b>
An Excel chart can be printed independently of the sheet or with the rest of the
content on the sheet:<br>
Chart Only: With the chart selected, go to the FILE tab – PRINT.<br>
Chart and Worksheet: With the chart NOT selected, go to the FILE tab -- PRINT.<br>
